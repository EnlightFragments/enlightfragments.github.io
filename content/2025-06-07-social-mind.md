Society did not emerge from nothing. It's not a physical entity. It exists as
a sign that we choose to associate ourselves with. Signification makes it
possible to manipulate this phantom. When we express what society thinks, we
influence those who associate themselves with the collective to align their
thoughts accordingly. It happens because humans do not tolerate contradiction
very well. "If I am a part of society, and society thinks \[A\], then I think
\[A\]". The conclusion is usually implicit.
