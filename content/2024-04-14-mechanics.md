We think via mechanics, but never notice it.

Mechanics of ownership: "Every thing has a connection to someone, who we call
the owner. The owner posesses the right to make decisions about how to use the
object of ownership."

Mechanics of questions: "A question is a phrase that implies a response should
be given in a form that clarifies the subject of the question."

Mechanics of problems: "A problem is an entity that prevents us from living the
life we desire. Every problem implies that it has some kind of solution, which
is a sequence of actions intended to resolve the problem."

…

Despite how obvious these mechanics are, they often go unnoticed. But when
declared explicitly, is raises questions about whether the foundation of human
thought can be something more than just adaptation to survive.

Lets continue.

Adaptation is also one of the mechanics: "Adaptation is a process of keeping an
organism from being degraded in changing conditions in order to sustain its
ability to live. This implies that the environment and the individual are
separate entities, and individual is the one who adapts to changing environment."

…

These mechanics are key elements of the thinking process. When we examine them
explicitly, we can begin to question if they are reasonable.

"There is self and everything else, which is the world. These are separate
entities."

"There is view, which is a representation of an entity for an individual."

"There is body and there is soul. Body is mortal. Soul is immortal. Soul resides
somewhere in your head."

"There is theory. It gets shaped in books, which can be read. This is how theory
meterializes by residing in minds."

"There is act of creation. Raw material gets shaped into something it never was
before. Of course, there is master, because it won’t get shaped by itself."

"There is an organism. It consists of lots of different parts which work together."

Somehow all these make sense.

Mechanics are not necessarily about objective knowledge, but rather about
understanding, something that encompasses both rational and irrational, as well
as subjective aspects.
