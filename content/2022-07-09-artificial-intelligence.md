 Many problems were solved with the help of technology. This path has lead us into the world, where machines are seen as gods by those who lack understanding. It’s easy to convince yourself that there's no problem machines can not resolve for us. That could be true, but we should speak their language - the formal language of routines, translated into the format of processors. This language is fundamentally different from what humans use in the sense that it is limited by what math can afford. Learning, however, is not a routine. It does not conform to formal rules. It's about transcending beyond current boundaries. That’s why machine will never be able to learn in an original sense. Algorithmic approximation of learning is all we can get here - and perhaps find a useful applications for it.
