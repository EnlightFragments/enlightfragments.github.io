 You will be born anyway, regardless of your desires. It wasn't your decision in the first place. Your body isn’t really yours, your soul isn’t really in your head, your life does not really belong to you. All your property isn’t really yours either. Ownership is nothing but a safeguard for the things which are not yours. It creates misconception, which leads to frustration, since it makes you expect more than there really is.
