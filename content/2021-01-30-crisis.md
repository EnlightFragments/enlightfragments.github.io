 Humans are the same “consumer goods” as the product being consumed. It’s hard to imagine there’s anything else left in humans.

 Feeling devastated is common in the surroundings we’ve created for ourselves. We create content, we consume content. We enjoy blissful ignorance, packed into consumable form for us.

 We give simple answers to difficult questions. Professional consumers teach us how to live. Digitally wasted with stories created by others.

No point in one’s own story left.
