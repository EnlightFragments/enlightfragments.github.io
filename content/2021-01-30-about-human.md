We aspire to perfection, which we have drawn for ourselves.
We are a perfect idea, privileged to think that we are able to look inside
ourselves from the outside perspective. We draw every path we can imagine.
We get sucked into life-long competition, from start to finish. That’s when we
lose sight of who we are, and the importance of our will. We choose to create
our egos and identify with them. Then we inflate it as high as we can.

This makes it much harder to harness our will. It makes us ask “What should I
do to make progress?” instead of “What do I want?”.

It becomes much clearer when you understand your own intentions, covert
motives, that’s when you truly start to think.

Take a look at what you see every day and ask yourself: What is it all about?
What intention does it serve? Does it conform with your intentions? Then life
won’t be so boring.
