Fear is an effective tool for controlling masses.
What masses fear the most is their own nonexistence.
Essentially, people ask to define "normal", so that they know what they should
strive for in order to exist.

It feels good to be regarded as a part of the "normal" group. It almost feels as though major forces
accept your existence. While the majority opts for the easy path by aligning themselves
with a definition of "normality", those regarded "abnormal" are doomed to feel the whole pressure.
