The answer to the question "What does it mean?" is predefined. It expects us
to provide the correct signified for a specified signifier based on ever-present

A more thought-provoking question would be "What is it?". This challenges us to
question essence, making doubt inevitable, as essence has multiple sides.

This form of a question encourages critical thinking.
