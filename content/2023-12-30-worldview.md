 Worldview is unavoidable. It tells you who you are, where you are and what you are meant to do. It creates all the necessary meanings to live a grounded life. Without it, mental paralysis can take hold.

 It doesn’t matter if you’re rich or poor, beautiful or ugly. What matters is knowing who you are and where you stand - otherwise, you risk living in an incomprehensible world, where nothing is certain, and every judgment falters when tested against itself.
