 How can you agree with someone when you not even listening to yourself first? You gave up on truth right from the beginning. You don’t need it. Anything is what you’re willing to accept as truth. Being no more than a passive observer in the theater of major forces, where reality is forged for you.

 Blind acceptance bypasses intuition, rendering you indifferent to your own conclusions.
